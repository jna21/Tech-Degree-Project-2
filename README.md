 List Pagination and Filtering
In this project I will utilize JavaScript to create a set up in which 10 student names, photos & emails and their info will display on a page  at a time.  
I wiil be adding navigation buttons to the bottom o the pate that will let users click on them to see 10 entries at  time.  My program will be able to handle
any size list and will adjust according to size.
